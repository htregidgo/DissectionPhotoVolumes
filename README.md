# DissectionPhotoVolumes
Tools for registering dissection photography into a coherent volume and 
perform segmentation for volumetric analysis. 

This is a repository for code accompanying the paper "3D Reconstruction 
and Segmentation of Dissection Photographs for MRI-free Neuropathology" 
accepted for publication at MICCAI 2020.

Registration Matlab code is provided. Segmentation code including 
python implementations of the Bayesian inference code will be updated 
to coincide with the conference.
